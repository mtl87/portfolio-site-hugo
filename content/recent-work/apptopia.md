### Apptopia is a growing player in the mobile app world, delivering its customers with market intelligence, analytics, and a marketplace through which to buy and sell apps. During my time at Apptopia, I had the great opportunity to be lead designer, allowing me to work closely with the co-founder and help bridge visual design to meet their needs in the product.

When I first started working for Apptopia, I was tasked with helping deliver an interface design for their analytics product. The product had just recently begun to take shape in development, so I worked with developers along with the co-founder to take requirements, sketch out the wireframe and then design the interface upon approval. This was a great learning opportunity for me as we worked in an agile environment to ideate, design and develop new features that would be iteratively added to the live app. I also learned a lot about Apptopia's users wants and needs for intelligence data and how best to facilitate the design.

As my time progressed at Apptopia, I took on more projects. A few examples of these projects were an analytics web app for their user base to consolidate all their analytics data, Fliptopia's brand redesign and Apptopia.com's company marketing pages to help instruct and onboard users.

It was greatly instructive to be involved in all facets of the business, working closely with all departments to assist in building clean and functional interfaces for all of Apptopia's digital touchpoints. The nature of the work trained me to practice lean UX prinsciples and to rapidly iterate based on co-founder and user feedback. It also honed my understanding of how to re-image designs with a focus on app conversions.
