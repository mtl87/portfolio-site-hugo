&lt;h3 id=&#34;brigham-and-women-s-hospital-bwh-world-renowned-for-their-innovative-burn-care-approached-the-adk-group-to-develop-a-first-of-its-kind-burn-care-app-with-this-app-bwh-aimed-to-help-regional-doctors-triage-and-communicate-with-the-expert-surgeons-at-bwh-s-trauma-and-burn-center-my-role-in-creating-this-app-was-to-deliver-a-full-ux-and-interface-design-for-both-the-native-app-and-web-app-experiences&#34;&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), world-renowned for their innovative burn care, approached the ADK Group to develop a first-of-its-kind Burn Care App. With this app, BWH aimed to help regional doctors triage and communicate with the expert surgeons at BWH’s Trauma and Burn Center. My role in creating this app was to deliver a full UX and interface design for both the native app and web app experiences.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked off this project by meeting with BWH’s technical lead, who presented the overall concept for the app and wireframes of its key screens. Starting the design sprint, I sketched rough wireframes of the ideal user flow for the app. Using a combination of Balsamiq and InvisionApp, I then fleshed out the wireframes into a complete user flow -  from registration prompts all the way to the page functionality. We presented this back to BWH’s team, who approved the user-flow and greenlit the interface design phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/bwh/bwh-sketch.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As time was of the essence for this project, I decided to build an interface off of &lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.design/ios10&#34;&gt;Facebook’s iOS and Android’s GUI library&lt;/a&gt; rather than design a totally unique app interface.&lt;/strong&gt; By utilizing existing pattern libraries and best practices in native app design, I opened up time for iterative testing and a comprehensive user-flow, and app reviews with the BWH doctors who would be using and referencing the app. In further brainstorming with doctors and client, we were able to discover a better way to deliver burn resource information both when a user is signed out and when they&amp;rsquo;re creating a page. The quick, comprehensive design and clear user-flow of the mobile app also allowed us to rapidly design and develop a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/bwh/bwh-resources.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the app build was a smashing success, which paved the way for additional projects with Brigham and Women’s Hospital. We are currently working to build a library of related apps for medical surveys and research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conviser Rebrand</title>
      <link>https://mtl87.github.io/recent-work/conviser-redesign/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2016 22:29:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mtl87.github.io/recent-work/conviser-redesign/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conviser prides itself on being one of Boston’s best “place-makers” for commercial real estate. Specializing in retail spaces for food and apparel, it is one of the region’s most successful brokerages. &lt;strong&gt;Conviser tasked ADK with a rebrand that would better reflect its prestige.&lt;/strong&gt; I was tasked with designing the company’s new logo and managing the brand accoutrements for web and print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/conviser/conviser-lockup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For this brand redesign, I wanted to provide a welcoming and approachable application that was underscored by cleanliness and modernity.&lt;/strong&gt; Through my iterative sketching of logotypes, I concluded that a waypoint-inspired letter “C” would be the perfect blend of their name and the placemaking that they do. Conviser requested that I incorporate the color yellow in the logo, which I emphasized with the sharp contrast of black. The end result was a clean and modern brand that emphasized their precision and professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/conviser/conviser-sketches.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Early digital sketches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the logo was approved, I built out support print elements (business cards, letterheads and envelopes) along with a new website. I worked hard to bring the new brand colors to life through the website experience, taking advantage of the strong contrast to build out an energizing homepage and portfolio page.  I even got to roll my sleeves up and dig into the site’s front-end code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/conviser/conviser-bizcard.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result was a rebrand that I am proud of, especially as I have heard how pleased CEO Adam Conviser is with it. It feels great to come across the logo in the wild, when I come across a building that is posted for lease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RIBC.org Redesign</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rhode-island-blood-center-ribc-rhode-island-s-foremost-provider-of-life-saving-blood-needed-to-bring-some-life-back-into-their-web-presence-in-this-project-i-collaborated-with-digital-strategists-on-my-team-and-ribc-s-marketing-director-to-refresh-and-deliver-the-site-s-user-experience-and-interface-design&#34;&gt;The Rhode Island Blood Center (RIBC), Rhode Island&amp;rsquo;s foremost provider of life-saving blood, needed to bring some life back into their web presence. In this project, I collaborated with digital strategists on my team and RIBC’s marketing director to refresh and deliver the site’s user experience and interface design.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/ribc/ribc-whiteboards.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Whiteboard wireframing sessions with RIBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our meetings with RIBC, we learned that despite being Rhode Island’s leading collector of blood donations, the website-driven donations and marketing were underwhelming. &lt;strong&gt;This was due, in part, to an outdated site that did not meet today’s best practices in content organization and device accessibility.&lt;/strong&gt; We had a our work cut out. We first started with meeting the RIBC team and stakeholders from all departments and even donors. It was truly great to meet everyone as they left lasting impressions of empathy in the ADK team and myself, which proved very useful for later stages of the redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/ribc/sketch-sprint.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sketch sprint of donation sign up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We engaged in long sessions of content-mapping and high-level wireframing to determine how to best lay out the new sitemap and user flow.&lt;/strong&gt; Afterwards, plugged our notes into UXPin to help build a prototype/wireframe of the proposed approach. After finessing this through several iterations, it was time for high fidelity design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/ribc/uxpin.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;UXPin interactive mockup to facilitate design direction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew inspiration from the Digital Design Standards for the US Goverment in thinking of how to deliver a clean and usable interface for users of all ages and demographics to interact with. &lt;strong&gt;Our content mapping was categorized along two of RIBC’s central themes: Community and Accessibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Community featured stories that support, engage, and highlight RIBC&amp;rsquo;s community of workers, donors, and donees. Accessibility facilitated awareness-building and donations with a clean, intuitive, informative, and responsive web platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/ribc/ribc-why-give.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Final visual design handed off to development using Zeplin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the project went into development, I provided our developers a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/ribc/RIBC-style-guide.jpg&#34;&gt;style guide&lt;/a&gt; to refer to as they built.&lt;/strong&gt; The platform was built on Drupal 8, which at the time was the most recent release of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the first few hours of the re-launch, appointments were already being made through the new in-site sign-up application. A few weeks later, mobile traffic had already increased by over 150%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Capa Microsite Template</title>
      <link>https://mtl87.github.io/recent-work/capa-microsite/</link>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;capa-a-study-abroad-program-provider-tasked-the-adk-team-with-redesigning-their-vast-collection-of-program-specific-microsites-my-role-was-twofold-to-assist-with-streamlining-the-content-architecture-and-to-design-a-more-intuitive-user-experience-for-college-student-users&#34;&gt;CAPA, a study abroad program provider, tasked the ADK team with redesigning their vast collection of program-specific microsites. My role was twofold: to assist with streamlining the content architecture, and to design a more intuitive user experience for college student users.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our initial interviews, we learned that CAPA’s microsites are multi-purpose: used as both a sales tool for schools and as an informational tool for students in different parts of the buying process. CAPA’s microsites needed to convey a large amount of information to a wide assortment of clients. Unfortunately, their existing strategies for doing so felt confusing and unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/capa/capa-cms-architecture.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;New CAPA Wordpress CMS site architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on our findings, I campaigned for a content re-map as a first step.&lt;/strong&gt; The current navigation was fixed to the left side of the page and displayed all pages in a single-tiered format, creating an overwhelming user experience. I brainstormed with our digital strategist to create new content maps that categorized content into broad themes of user-specific information. We presented these proposed categories to CAPA’s sales and copywriting team. They approved and began to reworking the content categories for all their current microsites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/capa/capa-microsite-architecture.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;New CAPA microsite content architecture remap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the re-mapping phase underway, I met with our technologist and lead developer to help brainstorm the best front-end design for the re-architected microsite ecosystem.&lt;/strong&gt; As this project called for rapid development, we decided to develop a modular system which would reuse the same components for all microsites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/capa/capa-mobile-site-mockup.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Responsive grid hosting a mobile optimized design for the mobile navigation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My design process required that I create a user interface style guide and determine how to provide the best overall user experience for all microsites, no matter their content.&lt;/strong&gt; In my sketches, I focused on an omnipresent navigation that allowed for quick accessibility to all content, and the ability to host branding for either CAPA or a specific university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/capa/capa-tablet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final design resulted in the top fold hosting a slim microsite title with supporting imagery for clear identification of the location, a navigation bar for the main categories, and a clean layout of content to deliver good vertical rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within a short period of time, we were able to launch CAPA&amp;rsquo;s new microsite system on a new WordPress build.&lt;/strong&gt; The new platform now hosts nearly 100 microsites. By CAPA’s account, the process and user experience have been greatly improved. The success of this project also opened the door to an opportunity for a main site redesign, currently in development at ADK.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile Commerce Template</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-a-designer-developer-at-unbound-commerce-the-1-mobile-commerce-provider-among-mid-market-retailers-i-helped-create-solutions-to-meet-the-demand-of-the-mobile-commerce-space-one-of-my-proudest-accomplishments-at-unbound-was-delivering-a-premium-mobile-site-template-to-streamline-the-company-s-product-design-processes&#34;&gt;As a designer/developer at Unbound Commerce, the #1 mobile commerce provider among mid-market retailers, I helped create solutions to meet the demand of the mobile commerce space. One of my proudest accomplishments at Unbound was delivering a premium mobile site template to streamline the company’s product design processes.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The premium mobile site template is a built-up experience featuring contemporary mobile UI patterns.&lt;/strong&gt; Features of the UI pattern I designed were a multi-functional navigation header that was fixed to the top on scrolling; a featured category slider on the homepage; large thumbnails with additional product details on the category listing pages; a robust product detail page featuring multiple images, additional reviews and product descriptions nested in an accordion; and a fluid template allowing for content and design to stretch to the edges of any device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/unbound/hp-wireframe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/unbound/product-wireframe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/unbound/monte-design.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The template design was an iterative process that had me adding and revising features as we gained feedback from clients and discovered new ways to improve user experience and interface.&lt;/strong&gt; Once we were comfortable with this new template, we released it to our Yahoo! Small Business customers as a full product offering (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unboundcommerce.com/yahoo-sign-up/&#34;&gt;https://www.unboundcommerce.com/yahoo-sign-up/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/unbound/bisket-baskets-mockup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our revamped design aided in netting over 120 new Yahoo! Small Business sign-ups in 2013 (a record high for the company at the time). The template became the new benchmark for building all mobile sites going forward (even for enterprise level), pushing us and our design and e-commerce partners to take mobile more seriously and to consider it as a solution against going responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apptopia Product Design</title>

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;apptopia-is-a-growing-player-in-the-mobile-app-world-delivering-its-customers-with-market-intelligence-analytics-and-a-marketplace-through-which-to-buy-and-sell-apps-during-my-time-at-apptopia-i-had-the-great-opportunity-to-be-lead-designer-allowing-me-to-work-closely-with-the-co-founder-and-help-bridge-visual-design-to-meet-their-needs-in-the-product&#34;&gt;Apptopia is a growing player in the mobile app world, delivering its customers with market intelligence, analytics, and a marketplace through which to buy and sell apps. During my time at Apptopia, I had the great opportunity to be lead designer, allowing me to work closely with the co-founder and help bridge visual design to meet their needs in the product.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started working for Apptopia, I was tasked with helping deliver an interface design for their analytics product. The product had just recently begun to take shape in development, so I worked with developers along with the co-founder to take requirements, sketch out the wireframe and then design the interface upon approval. This was a great learning opportunity for me as we worked in an agile environment to ideate, design and develop new features that would be iteratively added to the live app. I also learned a lot about Apptopia&amp;rsquo;s users wants and needs for intelligence data and how best to facilitate the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my time progressed at Apptopia, I took on more projects. A few examples of these projects were an analytics web app for their user base to consolidate all their analytics data, Fliptopia&amp;rsquo;s brand redesign and Apptopia.com&amp;rsquo;s company marketing pages to help instruct and onboard users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mtl87.github.io/img/apptopia/fliptopia-fullsize.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was greatly instructive to be involved in all facets of the business, working closely with all departments to assist in building clean and functional interfaces for all of Apptopia&amp;rsquo;s digital touchpoints. The nature of the work trained me to practice lean UX prinsciples and to rapidly iterate based on co-founder and user feedback. It also honed my understanding of how to re-image designs with a focus on app conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
