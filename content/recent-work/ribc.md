## Overview

Rhode Island Blood Center (RIBC) is Rhode Island's foremost provider of life-saving blood. Despite being one of the region's most active blood banks, its website-driven donations were underwhelming. RIBC approached ADK with the vision of expanding its life-saving impact by revitalizing their digital platform - building creating modern gateway through which to raise awareness, connect with potential donors, and facilitate donations in a more intuitive and human way.

## Strategy

**Accessibility:** facilitate awareness-building and donations with a clean, intuitive, informative, and responsive web platform

**Community:** feature stories that support, engage, and highlight RIBC's community of workers, donors, and donees.

Based on this strategy, we remodeled the site's vast content to transform the story of RIBC into one that was more personable and empathetic. From this content, we created an entirely new pattern library for RIBC.org. I developed prototypes to facilitate and test content with stakeholders, and made high fidelity mockups to ensure a confident sign-off and to assist in development.

- Meeting with all RIBC stakeholders and understanding their needs and current limitations
- Spent time understanding users and industry
- Re-develop content into a new content architecture themed around accessibility and community
- Rapid sketching sessions to map content into wireframes and test through prototyping
- Design a pattern library and top priority pages
- Develop full experience
- QA test and launch

## Results

Within the first few hours of the re-launch, appointments were already being made (through the new in-site sign-up application. A few weeks later, mobile traffic had already increased by over 150%.
