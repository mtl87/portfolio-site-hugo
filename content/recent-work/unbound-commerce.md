### As a designer/developer at Unbound Commerce, the #1 mobile commerce provider among mid-market retailers, I helped create solutions to meet the demand of the mobile commerce space. One of my proudest accomplishments at Unbound was delivering a premium mobile site template to streamline the companyâ€™s product design processes.

**The premium mobile site template is a built-up experience featuring contemporary mobile UI patterns.** Features of the UI pattern I designed were a multi-functional navigation header that was fixed to the top on scrolling; a featured category slider on the homepage; large thumbnails with additional product details on the category listing pages; a robust product detail page featuring multiple images, additional reviews and product descriptions nested in an accordion; and a fluid template allowing for content and design to stretch to the edges of any device.

**The template design was an iterative process that had me adding and revising features as we gained feedback from clients and discovered new ways to improve user experience and interface.** Once we were comfortable with this new template, we released it to our Yahoo! Small Business customers as a full product offering (https://www.unboundcommerce.com/yahoo-sign-up/).

Our revamped design aided in netting over 120 new Yahoo! Small Business sign-ups in 2013 (a record high for the company at the time). The template became the new benchmark for building all mobile sites going forward (even for enterprise level), pushing us and our design and e-commerce partners to take mobile more seriously and to consider it as a solution against going responsive.
