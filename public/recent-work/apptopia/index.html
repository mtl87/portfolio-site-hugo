During my time at Apptopia, I had the great opportunity to be lead designer, allowing me to work closely with the co-founder and help bridge visual design to meet their needs in the product.</h3>

<p>When I first started working for Apptopia, I was tasked with helping deliver an interface design for their analytics product. The product had just recently begun to take shape in development, so I worked with developers along with the co-founder to take requirements, sketch out the wireframe and then design the interface upon approval. This was a great learning opportunity for me as we worked in an agile environment to ideate, design and develop new features that would be iteratively added to the live app. I also learned a lot about Apptopia&rsquo;s users wants and needs for intelligence data and how best to facilitate the design.</p>

<p>As my time progressed at Apptopia, I took on more projects. A few examples of these projects were an analytics web app for their user base to consolidate all their analytics data, Fliptopia&rsquo;s brand redesign and Apptopia.com&rsquo;s company marketing pages to help instruct and onboard users.</p>

<p><img src="https://mtl87.github.io/img/apptopia/fliptopia-fullsize.jpg" alt="alt" /></p>

<p>It was greatly instructive to be involved in all facets of the business, working closely with all departments to assist in building clean and functional interfaces for all of Apptopia&rsquo;s digital touchpoints. The nature of the work trained me to practice lean UX prinsciples and to rapidly iterate based on co-founder and user feedback. It also honed my understanding of how to re-image designs with a focus on app conversions.</p>
