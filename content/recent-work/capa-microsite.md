### CAPA, a study abroad program provider, tasked the ADK team with streamlining the architecture of their vast collection of program-specific microsites. Their goal: improved information architecture, in-house microsite creation capability, and enhanced user experience.

#### Getting Started

We began with interviewing CAPA stakeholders and gathered a important information on the requirements and purpose of the microsites. Important take aways: microsites would all host unique content in different stages of the application for the college student and some colleges would have their study abroad offices manage the microsite.

Based on our findings from CAPA interviews and reviewing the current site, I campaigned for a content re-map as a first step. Currently the left navigation was full with one tiered level pages that made for a daunting experience. CAPA team openly approved this and had their team begin bucketing the content.  I brainstormed new maps that bucketed content into broad themes of user-specific information. This laid the foundation for a more coherent design process.

#### Wireframing and Prototyping

I first began sketching designs out of how we could build a less navigation heavy site. to build our site prototypes and demo them to the CAPA team. After receiving immediate approval, we wrapped up final high-fidelity mockups and built out pattern library for new microsite templates.

- Meeting with all CAPA microsite stakeholders to understand needs and current limitations
- Re-map content and sitemap to become a single portal for new content
- Devise a development strategy
- Prototype designs and present to stakeholders
- Create high fidelity mockups and style guide
- Develop
- QA test and launch

## Results

Within a short period of time, CAPA's new microsite system launched on our new WordPress build. The new platform now hosts over 80 separate microsites' content in one CMS, greatly streamlining content management and brand cohesiveness. The success of this project also opened the door to an opportunity for a main site redesign, currently in development at ADK.
